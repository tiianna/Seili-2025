# BalticSeaBioMed Summer School in Seili 2025

The Summer School on Human Health and Environment by the Baltic Sea in Seili is organised by the Nordic network BalticSeaBioMed, comprised of the Universities of Eastern Finland, Southern Denmark, Turku, Vilnius, Åbo Akademi University and Karolinska Institutet.

BalticSeaBioMed builds on the highly successful work of our founding network, NordBioMedNet, and makes an important innovative leap to bring state-of-the-art biomedical methodology into global health research. Here, we apply funding for a new Master's level intensive course to teach with new digi-pedagogical tools and focus on a new theme: the environmental impact of human behaviour. As an example and an educational “case study”, we will examine the effect of human use of pharmaceuticals and certain other harmful factors or changes on the Baltic Sea, and study them with modern biomedical omics technologies and large-scale data analysis using advanced computational methods. Our goal is to train the students in the skills and competencies required to solve complex problems of global health by using the challenges closer to us; the populations and well-being around the Baltic Sea as an example.

For the official program, see https://ki.instructure.com/courses/28543

## Learning aims:

- Understand key concepts in human health, planetary health, and modern biomedicine, including fundamental ethical, societal, and environmental considerations.
- Analyse the complex relationships and interactions between human health, planetary health, and biomedicine from multidisciplinary and multicultural perspectives.
- Apply practical skills in environmental sampling, computational biomedicine, and multi-omics data analysis, while collaborating effectively within diverse teams.
- Evaluate biomedical problems and methodologies, communicate solutions clearly, and reflect on their broader ethical, economic, and societal implications.

## Tasks for before the Summer School

Please get familiar with the following material and platforms:

### 1. The Ethics of Biomedicine
Please go through the oneline material. 
The link to the bioethics module is [here](https://ki.eu-west.catalog.canvaslms.com/browse/oer/courses/the-ethics-of-biomedicine-2025)

### 2. Group work

Here you will learn about getting most from the group work: https://rise.articulate.com/share/YOSU8I4BZjkJZK4_KUlIjcvBVzBMvs1x<br>
Please, download and fill in [the Group Contract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FGXvsIj3rQHaUlSEHfysecQqVYXKVVat/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=108198762102362181813&rtpof=true&sd=true) with your group members.  

### 3. R coding

If you are not familiar with R or need to fresh up to run basic R code, please go through the Part 1 of the online [R course "Hands-On Programming with R"](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) by Garrett Grolemund. It is a good idea to install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org)) beforehand and run the code on your own computer while going through the book. The rest of the book is also highly recommended and contains structures (data frames, loops, ect.) that you will use during project work!

### 4. Protein interaction
Please take this online course: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/protein-interactions-and-their-importance/

If you are not already familiar with the STRING database, we highly recommend that you go through the short [STRING exercises](https://jensenlab.org/training/string/) to learn about the underlying data before working with it in these exercises.

### 5. Introduction to biomacromolecular structure
Please take this online course: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/biomacromolecular-structures/

**Introduction to AlphaFold3 for predicting 3D structures for proteins**<br>
Please take the _Introductory guide to AlphaFold's strengths and limitations_ of this online course: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/an-introductory-guide-to-its-strengths-and-limitations/. The course is comprehensive but only the introduction is compulsory and, thereafter, please [Test your knowledge](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/courses/alphafold/an-introductory-guide-to-its-strengths-and-limitations/test-your-knowledge/). 

### 6. Install Cytoscape and PyMOL

_Cytoscape_:
Please make sure that you have the latest version of Cytoscape installed. Then start Cytoscape and update the current apps if necessary by checking the App Updates icon in the right-most corner of the manubar.

The exercises require you to have certain Cytoscape apps installed. Go to the [Cytoscape App Store](https://apps.cytoscape.org/) in your web browser and search for stringApp, select the app and press the Install button to install it. Similarly, make sure you have the yFiles Layout Algorithms and clusterMaker2 apps installed before switching back to Cytoscape.

_PyMOL_: 
PyMOL is a molecular visualization program for studying and preparing figures of macromolecular 3D structures. <br>
Please download and install PyMOL2.6 on your laptop: [Instructions how to download and install PyMOl](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dstgCJWxNRLcxs6P9uty7EDVVYL9a6M_/view?usp=drive_link). You will get the license file for the program later during the course.
